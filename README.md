# Building

You will need to install the following libraries and make sure they are on your `PATH`:
 * [cJSON](https://github.com/DaveGamble/cJSON/)
 * [SDL2](https://www.libsdl.org/download-2.0.php)
 
Then you can build by running `Make`.

For now, the Makefile will probably work on Debian 9 or similar operating systems.
